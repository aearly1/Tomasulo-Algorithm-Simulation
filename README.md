A simulation of tomasulo's algorithm for dynamic scheduling implemented in Java. The life cycle of an instruction begins in the instruction queue, where instructions wait until the needed resources are allocated for them. Depending on the instruction type, the instructions are then assigned to the appropriate reservation station (ADD, SUB, DIV, MUL), or buffer (LOAD, STORE). Afterwards, Instructions are chosen for execution depending on the availability of their operands, enabling out-of-order execution. Finally, after executing, the instructions write to the data memory (simulated by an array) if called-for.
